I'm Vedhu.

I am an iOS and Web Developer. I'm the founder and CTO of This Website. I ❤️ non-veg and Chai.

I started learning to code when I was 19 years old because I wanted to make my own websites. Over time,
I have gained a wealth of experience designing and developing web applications.

Hot Wings Challenge

But my best skill is actually in eating hot wings. I am the undisputed queen of hot wing challenges.
Ghost Peppers and Carolina Reapers are my favourite snacks.
